# KerniganAndRitchieExercises
> Exercises I worked at from "The C Programming Language" (Kernighan, B. and Ritchie, D. 1988. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall.)
> I coded these a few years ago now and have included them out of historical interest as K+R encouraged me to learn my second programming language; 
> my language of choice at the time was Python.
