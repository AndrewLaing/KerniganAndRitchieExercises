# KerniganAndRitchieExercises
> Exercises that I completed from the seminal book "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.
> These were coded a few years ago now and are included out of interest as the book encouraged me to learn my second language; 
> my language of choice at the time was Python.
